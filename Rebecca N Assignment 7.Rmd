This notebook is for EDRM 718 Assignment #7 linking R, GitHub, and GitKraken.
This is writing a function.

This is a function to make a linear equation 
```{r}
mod <- function(x,y,p){
  model <- lm(x~y)
  summary(model)
  attributes(model)
  Residuals <- ((resid(model)^2)^(1/2))
  Sort_Residuals <- sort(Residuals,decreasing = TRUE)
  cutoff <- Sort_Residuals[p]
  logical_residual <- (Residuals >= cutoff)
  return(logical_residual)
```
